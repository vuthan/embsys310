**Wireless Bluetooth Headphone**
Wireless bluetooth headphone is an audio output device connects to an dedicated audio source; mobile phone, desktop or laptop ... etc ...
via bluetooth technology operating on rechargable battery. It provides user a freedom of movements while listening to sound playing out 
from audio source.

**Features and Challenges:** Device has to be light weight.  Its battery has to last atleast more than 8 hours.  Its form factor must be compacted, providing
and comfortable for user to wear it for few hours or all day.  Its softwware must know when to broadcast signal for pairing with audio source device and only
connect to one audio source at any given time, while maintaining reliable connection.  If it lost signal from audio source, it must notify
user.  It must has powermanagement feature to maximize battery life.  It must know when to alert user when its battery is low.  It must 
have security features to prevent hackers to listen to user's audio source.

**Development challenge:**  Hard to debug because no display screen to see software execution except 1 or 2 LED(s) and output speaker.
It only has couple buttons as inputs.  Its hardware resources are very limited due to cost per unit must be very low for mass volume
production.

**Hardware cost challenges:**  Wireless bluetooth headphone will be mass produced. Therefore its hardware selection for development; audio chip, 
bluetooth chips, memory .. etc .. must be at very low cost.
