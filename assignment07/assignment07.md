  2. Generate the map file for your program and provide details on:
     * a. How much total ROM your program is occupying?  **388 + 80 = 468 bytes**
     * b. How much total RAM your program is using?      **2,052**
     * c. What part of your program is using the most ROM?  **The codes of program and constant variables**
     * d. What part of your program is using the most RAM?  **Program Stack that its size is set in IAR**
      
  3. **Bonus:** Anything that can be done to optimize the usage of ROM or RAM resources? Stack size and global 
      variables are placed in RAM. if Stack Size set accordingly and limited use of global variables can optimize usage of **RAM**.
      While codes and constant variables are placed in **ROM**.  Writing a simple, precise codes to perform neccessary required 
      tasks and limit the usage of constant variables can optimize usage of **ROM**
