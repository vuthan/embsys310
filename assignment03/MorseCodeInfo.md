**International Morse Code**
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, an inventor of the telegraph.  Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of **dots** and **dashes**. The **dot** duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a **dash** is three times the duration of a **dot**. Each **dot** or **dash** within a character is followed by period of signal absence, called a **space**, equal to the **dot** duration. The letters of a word are separated by a **space** of duration equal to **three dots**, and the words are separated by a **space** equal to **seven dots**.

The American artist **Samuel F. B. Morse**, the American physicist **Joseph Henry**, and **Alfred Vail** developed an electrical telegraph system to transmit natural language using only electrical pulses and the silence between them. Around 1837, Morse developed an early forerunner to the modern International Morse code.  In his earliest code, Morse had planned to transmit only numerals and to use a codebook to look up each word according to the number which had been sent.  However, in 1840, Alfred Vail expanded the codes to include letters and special characters.
